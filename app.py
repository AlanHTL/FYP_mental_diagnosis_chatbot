        1. **If you are in an immediately dangerous situation (such as on a rooftop, bridge, or with means of harm):**
        - Move to a safe location immediately

        - Call Suicide Prevention Service hotline (Cantonese): (852) 2382 0000

        **Are you currently in a safe location?** If not, please seek immediate help using the emergency contacts above.
